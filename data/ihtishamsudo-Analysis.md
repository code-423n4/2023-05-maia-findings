Based on my experience doing this audit was pretty good because that's my first audit I've found a bunch of High + med vulns and it indicates that the code needs more improvement. 
Answering The Questions:
## Analysis of the codebase (What's unique? What's using existing patterns?)
Overall, there is a good effort from the dev team of Maia, but it still needs much improvement. What I found unique in Maia is using MVC Architectural patterns very efficiently. It adheres to the MVC architectural pattern, separating concerns between models, views, and controllers & that's a very good thing for the protocol itself.
The overall codebase is too huge which makes it difficult to handle all the External Calls from being exploited as I have found most vulnerabilities are from External Calls. So, there must be a good implementation of External Calls. Otherwise, Maia has to face a severe loss whether it's the loss of funds or loss of the system maintenance. One more thing that Maia Protocol needs more audits like this one because this protocol lacks very much a well written & exploit proof code. Bacause, Larger the protocol more the vulns. Overall, codebase will be much better because many wardens are taking care of this protocol and protocol will have the better approach in sense of security of the system after mitigation of this contest.
## Architecture Feedback
As A Security Researcher, I will point out multiple things to be considered.

```Hermes:```

Ensure that the lockers' direct emissions to gauges are implemented securely to prevent any potential manipulation or unauthorized access to revenue.
Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect locker accounts and their associated funds.
Perform thorough testing and auditing of the smart contracts involved in the lock and voting mechanisms to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.
Implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to the lockers' liquidity farming rewards and rebases.
Regularly monitor and update the system to address any emerging security threats or vulnerabilities.
```Maia:```

Conduct a security assessment of the Partner bHermes Vault to identify any potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors.
Ensure that the staking process for Maia and conversion to vMaia is secure and resistant to potential attacks.
Implement proper audit trails and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to any suspicious activities related to Maia and its associated utilities.
Apply best practices for secure handling of user funds and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect the vault.
```Talos:```

Perform a thorough security audit of the decentralized Uniswap V3 Liquidity Management protocol to identify and mitigate any potential security risks.
Ensure that the LP creation and management processes are secure and properly validate input parameters to prevent manipulation or unauthorized access.
Implement adequate measures to protect LP assets, including secure key management and protection against potential attacks on LP positions.
Regularly update and patch the protocol to address any discovered security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
```Ulysses:```

Conduct a security assessment of the Virtualized Liquidity and Unified Liquidity components to identify any security risks associated with cross-chain asset handling and the stable swap AMM.
Ensure that the messaging layer (any call v7) used for virtualized liquidity is properly secured to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with assets.
Implement robust security measures to protect the Multi-Asset ERC4626 tokenized vault and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the deposited assets.
Regularly monitor and update the system to address any security vulnerabilities or emerging threats.
## Centralization risks
There is only one spot where I find that there might be a centralization risk which is ```Governance```. It's important to look out for the governance utility because mostly centralized risks are often found in Governance in Web 3 Protocol. So,  It is important to evaluate the governance model and assess whether it allows for decentralized decision-making and community participation.
## Systemic risks
There are a bunch of Systematic Risks. Many of them you can find out in my Reports and Findings. For Instance, Incorrect Implementation of ```ERC20 Interface``` in ```IWETH9.sol```, Benign Reentrancy that can unexpectedly exploit a contract and much more.
## Other recommendations
The Codebase is pretty huge, the devs need to be able to implement security guidelines while designing or maintaining the system. It Means the developer should have enough knowledge of security as well. Because a little flaw in such large code base can make trouble for developers. The Developers must be experienced to maintain the Maia in the future. There Lacks a focus on ```Guages``` contracts that needs more attention of the developers as well as security researchers.
## How much time did you spend?
I didn't count hours but based on the days so I spent roughly 10-12 Days and each day I dedicated 2-3 hours, So, Basically 25-30 hours on this protocol.

### Time spent:
25 hours
