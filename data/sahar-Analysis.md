 It is written in vMaia section : “Users can stake their MAIA tokens at any time, but can only withdraw their staked tokens on the first Monday of each month
”
The fact that users are only permitted to withdraw their staked tokens once a month may deter potential users from joining the ecosystem. Most users prefer to have regular access to their assets, instead of being limited to a single monthly withdrawal.

In the link above, in the two mentioned cases, the launch date is mentioned in 2022. It seems that this part of the document was carelessly copied from version one, or because the launch date was delayed, this issue was forgotten to be corrected in the documents as well."
 
They are:

1.The launch phase was the first phase of the Maian ecosystem and lasted for 24 hours. During this phase, a total of 2712 MAIA tokens were minted and locked for 10 days until January 14th 2022

2.The initial distribution/bootstrap phase was the second phase of the Maian ecosystem and lasted until August 2022

This issue of constant competition among  gauges to obtain user votes increases the amount of bribery given to users in the long run, resulting in a decrease in gauges profits and revenue over time. This weakness in the ecosystem can be addressed by considering other incentive mechanisms for users to purchase votes alongside bribery, thus reducing the financial costs of bribery for gauges.

In hermes section (The Boost Aggregator Factory) The fact that only the user who has deposited the NFT can redeem it makes it impossible to sell the NFT during the deposit period. There is a scenario where an NFT owner may want to sell it in the same deposited state, in which case the new owner cannot redeem the NFT. In a worse case scenario, a user may not be aware of this and sell the NFT, making it practically impossible to redeem it. This issue can easily be solved by creating a new function that allows for ownership changes. The profit for the deposit period can be recalculated based on the time of ownership change. However, this ownership change must be a two-step process to prevent accidental and erroneous transfer to an unintended address.

In the link above, in rows three and five of section “Max Proposal Threshold”, the number of tokens is written as a quantity (while in other cases, it is written as a percentage of the total supply). It is recommended that these numbers also be written as a percentage. This is because in the future, the total supply may change and as a result, these numbers written here may change as well. A fixed number should not be considered for the required number of tokens. Instead, it should be in percentage form.

There is a potential risk, albeit with low probability, that poses a significant threat to the Maya ecosystem. This threat arises from the Arbiteroom network, which acts as a crucial component for all Maya activities. A failure or disruption in this network could cause a ripple effect and adversely impact all other activities. It is noteworthy that a section of the Arbiteroom network's activities is centralized, increasing the risk of downtime.

While the likelihood of such an event occurring is minimal, it is highly recommended that a solution is sought to mitigate any potential impact on the Maya ecosystem and its users.

"The project and its architecture were developed using UniSwap v3. However, with the upcoming release of version 4 of UniSwap , it is necessary to re-evaluate all architecture and smart contracts within the current MAIA project to ensure compatibility with the new UniSwap version. Additionally, taking advantage of the changes made in UniSwap V4 will ultimately benefit both the project and its users so future changes need to be considered.
