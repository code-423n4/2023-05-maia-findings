## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
- Read documentation
- Watched codebase walk through videos
- Studied code
- Asked questions from sponsor
- Found bugs

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
- Learned about Multichain

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
- Most bugs found were due to wrong assumptions made and incorrect generalization of some correct assumptions, especially when integrating with multichain.
