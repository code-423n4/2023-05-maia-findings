# Maia DAO Ecosystem Analysis
## Comment & Approach
### Initial Assessment:
 * Started by skimming through the overall codebase, looking for commonly found keywords or similar 
protocol implementations.
 * Noted a similar bug in the governance contracts, based on previous audits of nounsdao.
 * Ran and checked the test files.

### Deep Dive into Rewards Portion:
 * Decided to focus on the Rewards portion of the protocol.
 * Noticed discrepancies between adding and removing reward contracts.
 * Reached out to the sponsor to understand the decision-making process.
 * Learned that the implementation faced a dilemma between bricking unclaimed rewards and users potentially gaming the "bribeflywheel" in the next epoch.

### Investigation of Ulysses Omnichain:
While comparing similar functionalities within the protocol, discovered that the normalize and denormalize functions had their logic interchanged.
Identified inconsistencies between tokens with potential different precision within Ulysses Omnichain.
Noticed instances where arithmetic operations and comparisons were performed between tokens with different precision.
Explored the workflow, specifically examining if users receive refunds when they overpay for gas while transacting across the omnichain.
Found that gas fees were refunded in BranchBridgeAgent.sol.
Observed that in RootBridgeAgent.sol, excess gas could be swept by the DAO, but the sweep function did not unwrap the ETH before attempting to sweep, resulting in accumulated fees being stuck in the wrapper contract.
Noted inconsistencies in the implementations of `RootBridgeAgent.sol` and `BranchBridgeAgent.sol`, causing issues with wrapping and unwrapping ETH.

* QA Report Compilation.

## Codebase quality analysis
| Category | Description |
|--- | --- |
|Access Controls | **Satisfactory**. Appropriate access controls were in place for performing privileged operations.|
|Arithmetic | **Moderate**. The contracts uses solidity version ^0.8.0 potentially safe from overflows and underflows. Underflow which could result in reverts can occur in Ulysses Omnichain if _deposit is more than amount.|
| Centralization | **Satisfactory**. Most critical functionalities are behind On-chain governance.|
| Code Complexity | **Moderate**. Although most part of the protocol were easy to understand, Ulysses Omnichain involves complex data parsing.|
|Contract Upgradeability | **Not Applicable**. Contracts are not upgradable.|
| Documentation | **Satisfactory**. High-level documentation and some in-line comments describing the functionality of the protocol were available.|
|Monitoring | **Satisfactory**. Events are emitted on performing critical actions.|
|Testing & Verification | **Moderate**. The repositories included tests for a variety of scenarios. beta testing is highly encouraged to ensure the overall protocol works as intended.|

## Centralization risks
No centralization risks were found as critical functionalities are accessed through on-chain governance. Additionally, there is an Emergency Multisig admin with veto powers. This admin has the authority to cancel malicious proposals but does not have the ability to override the governance voting process.

## Mechanism review
* DAO Governance: The Maia DAO ecosystem is governed by its community of token holders who participate in the decision-making process. Token holders can propose and vote on changes, upgrades, or other initiatives within the ecosystem. Governance decisions are typically made using voting mechanisms, where token holders can cast their votes proportional to the number of tokens they hold.

* Investment Strategies: Maia DAO offers a range of investment strategies to its participants. These strategies are designed to provide exposure to different assets and investment opportunities, such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, or other digital assets. The specific investment strategies offered by Maia DAO can vary over time based on market conditions and community proposals.

* Tokenomics: The Maia DAO ecosystem has its native token, which typically plays a central role in the governance and economic aspects of the ecosystem. The token may have various utilities, such as voting rights, staking, rewards, or fee sharing. The tokenomics of Maia DAO can incentivize active participation and align the interests of the ecosystem's participants.

* Staking and Rewards: Maia DAO may offer staking mechanisms, allowing token holders to lock their tokens for a certain period to support network security or participate in governance. In return for staking, token holders may receive rewards, such as additional tokens or a share of the fees generated within the ecosystem.

* Cross-Chain Interoperability : The Maia DAO ecosystem using anycall v7 as messaging layer means that an asset deposited from a specific chain, is recognized as a different asset from the "same" asset but from a different chain.

* Smart Contracts and Automation: Smart contracts play a crucial role in the Maia DAO ecosystem by automating various processes, such as voting, fund management, and reward distribution. These smart contracts are typically executed on the blockchain, providing transparency, security, and immutability.

## Systemic risks
* Smart contract vulnerabilities: Smart contracts form the backbone of the Maia DAO ecosystem. If there are vulnerabilities in the code, it could be exploited by malicious actors, resulting in financial losses or disruption of the ecosystem.

* Blockchain Platform: Arbitrum may face issues with data availability and security.
Arbitrumâ€™s challenge period can be up to one week, which can lead to slower finality and higher latency. but this can be a trade-off between gas fees and data availability.

* Governance flaws: DAOs rely on decentralized governance mechanisms for decision-making. However, if the governance model is susceptible to manipulation, it could lead to biased decision-making, centralization of power, or governance gridlock.

* Regulatory challenges: The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and DAOs is still evolving. Maia DAO could face regulatory challenges or uncertain legal frameworks in certain jurisdictions, which may impact its operations and growth.

* Economic instability: The Maia DAO ecosystem may be influenced by broader economic factors, such as market volatility, inflation, or financial crises. These external factors can impact the value and stability of the assets held within the ecosystem.

* Market manipulation: As with any financial ecosystem, there is a risk of market manipulation within the Maia DAO ecosystem. Manipulative practices, such as pump-and-dump schemes or insider trading, can distort prices and harm the overall integrity of the ecosystem.

* Sybil attacks: Sybil attacks involve individuals or entities creating multiple identities to gain undue influence or control over a decentralized system. If the Maia DAO ecosystem is susceptible to such attacks, it could lead to unfair decision-making or manipulation of the voting process.
