It is possible to add one bandwith more than the maximum. The function `addNewBandwith` in [UlyssesPool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/54a45beb1428d85999da3f721f923cbf36ee3d35/src/ulysses-amm/UlyssesPool.sol#L171) checks that `index <= MAX_DESTINATIONS` to be able to add one. However, given the fact that `index = bandwidthStateList.length`, which returns the COUNT of elements, the condition that follows `if (index > MAX_DESTINATIONS) revert TooManyDestinations();` lets you (the owner) add one more. For example, you have `MAX_DESTINATIONS` bandwiths in `bandwidthStateList` so that `index = MAX_DESTINATIONS`. The idea is to not be able to add more, but the `>` lets you add one more. TLDR => rewrite the condition to `if (index >= MAX_DESTINATIONS) revert TooManyDestinations();` or `if (index == MAX_DESTINATIONS) revert TooManyDestinations();` to avoid adding an additonal bandwith

In [UlyssesPool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/54a45beb1428d85999da3f721f923cbf36ee3d35/src/ulysses-amm/UlyssesPool.sol#L206-L207) the keys do not match with the logical name. That is, for `destinations, which is supposed by the name to hold pairs (address, index), has instead (id, index) and the `destinationIds` is the same. Just a suggest, be coherent with the name of the variables and how/for what are they used
