1-wrong event emitted in the TalosBaseStrategy.sol contract have a rebalance() function that incorrectly emits the Rerange event instead of the Rebalance event.
It is crucial to ensure that events are properly emitted in a contract to maintain transparency, interoperability, and user confidence in the system.

2- Emitting the Snapshot event with uninitialized values of `cache.amount0Desired` and `cache.amount1Desired` may produce unexpected or misleading data when listening to the emitted event.
To ensure accurate and expected behavior, it is important to initialize the `PoolVariables.Info` struct before utilizing its members in calculations.

-4 in the `GovernorBravoDelegateMaia.sol` contract after the `queueOrRevertInternal` `timelock.queueTransaction` should return bool, confirming it is successful https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/54a45beb1428d85999da3f721f923cbf36ee3d35/src/governance/GovernorBravoDelegateMaia.sol#L201-L202

5- In `PartnerManagerFactory.sol` If the check partners[partnerIds[partnerManager]] != partnerManager fails, it will revert with an InvalidPartnerManager error. However, this error message doesn't provide any meaningful information about what exactly is invalid. It would be helpful to have a more specific error message to assist with debugging.

6-Initialized struct variables in event `poolVariable` contract

The event emitted for the `snapshot` should be updated as follows:

event `Snapshot` (uint256 totalAmount0, uint256 totalAmount1, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 liquidity);

And the emitted `snapshot` should be updated accordingly:

emit Snapshot(cache.amount0, cache.amount1, cache.tickLower, cache.tickUpper, cache.liquidity);

This ensures that all the relevant values from the cache struct are included in the emitted `Snapshot` event.
