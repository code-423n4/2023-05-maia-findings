1-wrong event emitted in the TalosBaseStrategy.sol contract have a rebalance() function that incorrectly emits the Rerange event instead of the Rebalance event.
It is crucial to ensure that events are properly emitted in a contract to maintain transparency, interoperability, and user confidence in the system.

2- Emitting the Snapshot event with uninitialized values of `cache.amount0Desired` and `cache.amount1Desired` may produce unexpected or misleading data when listening to the emitted event.
To ensure accurate and expected behavior, it is important to initialize the `PoolVariables.Info` struct before utilizing its members in calculations.

-4 in the `GovernorBravoDelegateMaia.sol` contract after the `queueOrRevertInternal` `timelock.queueTransaction` should return bool, confirming it is successful https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia/blob/54a45beb1428d85999da3f721f923cbf36ee3d35/src/governance/GovernorBravoDelegateMaia.sol#L201-L202

5- In `PartnerManagerFactory.sol` If the check partners[partnerIds[partnerManager]] != partnerManager fails, it will revert with an InvalidPartnerManager error. However, this error message doesn't provide any meaningful information about what exactly is invalid. It would be helpful to have a more specific error message to assist with debugging.

6-Initialized struct variables in event `poolVariable` contract

The event emitted for the `snapshot` should be updated as follows:

event `Snapshot` (uint256 totalAmount0, uint256 totalAmount1, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 liquidity);

And the emitted `snapshot` should be updated accordingly:

emit Snapshot(cache.amount0, cache.amount1, cache.tickLower, cache.tickUpper, cache.liquidity);

This ensures that all the relevant values from the cache struct are included in the emitted `Snapshot` event.

 Incorrect Return Type and Error Placement in amountsDirection() Function.

The amountsDirection() function in the codebase currently exhibits two issues:

Issue 1: Missing Return Type
In the existing code, the amountsDirection() function does not specify a return type. As a result, the function's behavior and intended output may be ambiguous, leading to potential confusion for developers and users. By adding a return type, we can ensure better clarity and understanding of the function's purpose.

Issue 2: Incorrect Placement of Error Call
Additionally, the amountsDirection() function seems to have an erroneous error call in the wrong place, leading to incorrect behavior. It is essential to place error calls at appropriate positions to handle exceptions and ensure accurate program execution. Reviewing and rectifying the placement of the error call can help prevent unexpected results and improve code reliability.

Missing Event in `IncreaseConversionRate` Function
The conversion rate function in the smart contract is missing an event statement, which reduces transparency and makes 
it challenging for external entities to track rate changes
the `increaseConversionRate` function should emit the `ConversionRateIncreased` event with the appropriate old and new rates as parameters. 

emit ConversionRateIncreased(oldRate, newRate);
