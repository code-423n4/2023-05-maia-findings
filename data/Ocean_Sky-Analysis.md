Analysis of Maia Ecosystem

1. Approach Taken in codebase evaluation
   Due to time limitation, I give priority to Omnichain accounting focusing 
   on Ulysses Protocol. In order to understand this protocol, I have to read first the high overview of 
   the process and the documentation before diving into the codebase. In this way, I can match the code 
   implementation versus the intention based on documentation. 

2. Learnings from evaluating the codebase
   I have learned the concepts behind cross-chain messaging, on how smart contracts from different 
   blockchain communicates with each other. However, this will take a lot of time to understand because 
   there is no complete sample on how the whole lifecycle of cross-chain transaction is happening inside 
   Ulysses Protocol. There should be a complete testing on how the whole cross-chain messaging lifecycle 
   works from the deposit of assets to original chain until withdrawal from destination chain.
   I would suggest to the sponsor to further simplify the codebase.

3. Comments for judge to contextualize the findings
   My findings are all can be found in Ulysses protocol. There are links of similar issue from past C4 
   finding to support the claim.
