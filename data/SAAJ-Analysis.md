# Approach
My approach related to Maia Dao audit was to first look at Automated findings which contain several issues in order to avoid them during my review process. Then, i go through previous audit reports of Zellic to get idea of issue found already.
My next approach was going through the videos on Notion site Maia page which makes it more easy to understand the fundamentals and working logic of the different smart contracts.
Video improve my understanding on how the protocol work from different contract interacting with each other like Hermes, Maia, Guage, Rewards and Ulysses-Ominchain.
Afterwards, I started looking from bottom to find optimisation areas with also searching for vulnerabilities on how project carry out its operation.
# Learning
I learned time management in area of managing a large codebase, that creates issues at beginner level. I go through one SC at a time to not get confused and understand every code snippet in depth.
# Comments
The video explainer helps in understanding the operational working of the project and going through code in a more understandable manner. Later i was able to find several medium issues with totally spending around 72 hours.



### Time spent:
