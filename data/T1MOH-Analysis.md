I took separate part of protocol and audited it separately. It was in following order: talos, uniswap-v3-staker, boost-aggregator, erc4626, returned again to Talos, governance, at the end started Ulysses but took a rest.

My mechanism of review. I review code 1 hour in concentration, then take a break 10 min - classical pomodoro. No more than 5 sessions a day, i.e. whole audit took 2 weeks with minimum days off.

Don't know what to say about architecture, noticed that all except Ulysses is forked projects. And all this forked projects contain issues where code is changed, especially in Talos (it is fork of Fraggola of Popsicle Finance)

### Time spent:
70 hours
