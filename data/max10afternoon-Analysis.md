Due to times limitations, and also due to the will to partecipate in other audits I was only able to spend around 5/6 days on this audit. Therefor, out of the 4 protocols that compose the Maia ecosystem, I've only focused on Talos, since it looked like the easiest to understand and more self contained of the 4. In particular I've spent most of my focus on the vanilla strategies, and the and their various  subcomponents, which have almost no interactions with other areas of the maia's codebase, vastly diminish the surface to cover. This enabled me to overcome the time limitations and helped me finding what I believe could be 2 interesting findings.
As a beginner this helped me further consolidating my familiarity with the, underlying, uniswap v3 protocol, especially the minting process.
All the analysis was done manually.
